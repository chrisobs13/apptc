      Dr. Tokarz received his B.A. (Cum Laude) from the State University of New York at Stony Brook.  He then received his M.A. and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.  Dr. Tokarz’ internship was completed at Western Missouri Mental Health Center which was approved by the American Psychological Association (APA).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1978, Dr. Tokarz was licensed as a Clinical Psychologist in Massachusetts.  During his 40 years in practice, he has treated more than 5,000 patients with anxiety disorders.  In 1978, Dr. Tokarz also began his specialized training in the cognitive-behavioral treatment of anxiety disorders with Drs. Alan Goldstein and Diane Chambless.  Drs. Goldstein and Chambless were pioneers in the cognitive-behavioral treatment of panic and agoraphobia.

    <p>
      Dr. Tokarz was also trained by Dr. David Barlow (of Boston University); the leading world authority on the treatment of panic and anxiety.  In 1993, Dr. Tokarz became one of approximately fifty psychologists and psychiatrists in the United States to be certified in Dr. Barlow’s Panic Control Treatment.  This treatment is evidence based upon empirically validated research and has a documented success rate of 87%-90% with panic disorder patients.  This cognitive-behavioral treatment program is short term (12-14 weeks), highly structured, and uses a manual to help produce its highly effective results. Dr. Tokarz also uses acceptance and mindfulness as part of his Cognitive Behavior Therapy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Tokarz has gone on to become a Master Trainer/Clinician on a national level in this panic control treatment.  Dr. Tokarz has trained and certified the staff of a major West Palm Beach medical hospital in this approach.  In addition, Dr. Tokarz has trained the entire psychiatry and psychology staff at the Medical Center of Iceland University in Dr. Barlow’s treatment of panic.  Dr. Tokarz has also lectured on the cognitive-behavioral treatment of panic at the University of British Columbia (Canada) and has made similar presentations at National Conferences.  Dr. Tokarz was on the staff of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital for eight years (1995-2003); where he supervised psychiatric residents and psychology interns in cognitive-behavioral therapy.
    <p>
      Currently, Dr. Tokarz is Board Certified in Cognitive and Behavioral Psychology which is the highest honor that can be achieved in the Clinical Practice of Psychology.  Dr. Tokarz has also become an examiner for the Board that certifies Psychologists in Cognitive and Behavioral Psychology and more recently he was designated as a Board Certified Fellow in Cognitive and Behavioral Psychology.
    </p>
