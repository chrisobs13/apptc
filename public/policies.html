  <h4>Cancellations</h4>
  <p>
    Irrespective of insurance coverage, the ultimate responsibility for any charges lie with the client.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>APPTC requires a 24-hour notice for cancellation of an appointment. Patients will be charged the full $125.00 fee for any cancellation made with less than 24 hours notice.  Your insurance company will not pay for this charge.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Our telephone number has 24-hour coverage, so Monday appointments may be cancelled during the weekend.  Late cancellations will be charged directly to the client and not to the insurance carrier.  Charges for missed appointments must be paid prior to rescheduling another appointment.

  <h4>
    Legal Consultation Policy
  </h4>
  <p>
    If Dr. Tokarz is involved in your case and he is subpoenaed by the "other side" (i.e., spouse, DSS, the Commonwealth, or any other source) to engage in a deposition or court testimony -- even if you did not request or desire his presence -- then he will be forced to bill you for his time at a rate of $400 per hour from the time he leaves his office until he returns.  These same rates apply if he voluntarily testifies at a deposition or court hearing on your behalf.  Also, all preparation time, tele-cons or face-to-face discussions with attorney, reviewing of medical records and reports used for courts or depositions will be billed at $400 per hour. Minimum court appearance or deposition retainer will be no less than $4,000 plus transportation fee of $400 per hour to and from APPTC office to location. Minimum fee for forensic evaluation and report will be no less than $4,500.00.
  </p>

  <h4>Insurance</h4>
  <p>
    APPTC is a provider for various insurance carriers (i.e., Harvard Pilgrim, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Magellan, United Behavioral Health, Health Care Value Management and Tufts. Most Policies contain either a client deductible and/or co-payment for which you are responsible. Co-plays do vary based on specific plans.  Some insurance companies may include APPTC under out-of-network Out-patient Mental Health benefits.  Payment is due at the time of service.
  </p>
  <p>
    APPTC does not accept Medicaid, Mass Health, Cigna, Neighborhood Health, or Beacon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, it is the patient's responsibility to check with their insurance carrier and confirm their benefits.  APPTC cannot be held responsible for errors made by your insurance carrier.  It is the patient's responsibility to notify APPTC of any insurance changes (i.e., a switch to another insurance company or dual coverage).
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4>After-Hours Coverage</h4>
  <p>
    APPTC will have a secretary or answering machine taking all calls Monday through Friday, 7:15 A.M. to 8 P.M., Dr. Tokarz will be available during these hours to respond to any emergencies.  However, if you have an emergency during uncovered hours, please go to the nearest hospital emergency room.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h4>Collections</h4>
  <p>
    If any client should incur a balance in excess of 60 days, APPTC will take them to Small Claims Court and report the delinquency to the credit bureaus, Equifax, Trans Union and Experian.  All expenses incurred during that process (i.e., consultation with lawyers, secretarial time going to court, certified letters, etc.) will be the responsibility of the patient.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clients should feel free to discuss any questions concerning
    this Office Policy with their therapist.
