  <h4>Cancellations</h4>
  <p>
    Irrespective of insurance coverage, the ultimate responsibility for any charges lie with the client.
  </p>

    <strong>APPTC requires a 24-hour notice for cancellation of an appointment. Patients will be charged the full $125.00 fee for any cancellation made with less than 24 hours notice.  Your insurance company will not pay for this charge.</strong>

    Our telephone number has 24-hour coverage, so Monday appointments may be cancelled during the weekend.  Late cancellations will be charged directly to the client and not to the insurance carrier.  Charges for missed appointments must be paid prior to rescheduling another appointment.

  <h4>Insurance</h4>
  <p>
    APPTC is a provider for various insurance carriers (i.e., Harvard Pilgrim, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Magellan, United Behavioral Health, Health Care Value Management and Tufts. Most Policies contain either a client deductible and/or co-payment for which you are responsible. Co-plays do vary based on specific plans.  Some insurance companies may include APPTC under out-of-network Out-patient Mental Health benefits.  Payment is due at the time of service.
  </p>

    APPTC does not accept Medicaid, Mass Health, Cigna, Neighborhood Health, or Beacon.

    Ultimately, it is the patient's responsibility to check with their insurance carrier and confirm their benefits.  APPTC cannot be held responsible for errors made by your insurance carrier.  It is the patient's responsibility to notify APPTC of any insurance changes (i.e., a switch to another insurance company or dual coverage).
